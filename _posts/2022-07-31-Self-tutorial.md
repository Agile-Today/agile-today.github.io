## DEFINITION

>This framework will enable you to extract the most relevant data from the source, structure it, and motivate you to search for new information.

The material obtained from a course or book is not always correlated with what was previously studied. In order to assist you in studying the material, the Spaced repetition method and the SCRUM method will be used.

## SOURCE⇨NOTES

> During the course, or while reading a book, we write out difficult-to-study or incomprehensible information and create a record of this topic in a notebook. We also add additional materials recommended by the author or independently found sources.

## NOTES ⇨ SCRUM

> We will use elements of SCRUM, with significant changes in roles: You will act as Scrum Master, Product owner, Development team

Topics become a user story at this point, and we add additional materials as tasks.

## SCRUM

>To be clear, we will adopt SСRUM’s elements but not the methodology itself.

-After we created all the user stories, we received a Backlog

-Before creating a Sprint Backlog, we need to evaluate each user story.

Create a Sprint Backlog and define the sprint duration after all tasks have been evaluated

## SCRUM ⇨ TUTORIAL

>Every time we study a new topic, we must transfer the most significant sections of the previously studied information to the tutorial, as well as connections to supplementary materials that are critical to comprehending the topic.

It is important to evaluate the topic during the transition to the tutorial so that we can repeat the most important parts of the content being studied the next time we return to the tutorial.
