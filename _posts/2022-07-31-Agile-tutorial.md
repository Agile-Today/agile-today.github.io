# Agile

### What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

###T he Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

-Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

-Working software over comprehensive documentation

-Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

-Responding to change over following a plan

With the Kanban Method, you visualize invisible knowledge work and how it moves through a workflow. This helps to effectively operate your business, including understanding and managing risks in delivering your services to the customers. With Kanban, you and your business will develop an adaptive capability over time to respond better and faster to changes in your customers’ needs and expectations or within your business environment.

-The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.

-The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

-Repeat
